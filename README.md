### Hi there 👋, I'm Mark!

I'm currently a Software Engineer in Ireland 🇮🇪 working on the full stack! Breaking a Django Monolith into FastAPI microservices on ECS in AWS, doing some React and TypeScript on the FrontEnd and doing some DevOps on AWS.

Certified AWS Developer ([Certificate](https://www.credly.com/badges/ffc7f82d-a5c9-481b-ac44-0122c07fd2e8?source=linked_in_profile)) and big fan of Cloud Computing ☁️.

Currently Building [ticketr.events](https://ticketr.events) a platform for selling payment plan and regular tickets for Event and Festival Organisers.

Built [Donation Store](https://donationstore.net) as my first side project using Django.

I like building stuff with Python, Django, FastAPI, React, TypeScript, distributed systems, Docker and AWS, but like exploring other frameworks and languages, like Kotlin and Spring.

I spend most of my spare time building side projects for clients and also trying to get into Open Source by customising the Django Framework with [Zark](https://github.com/mark-barrett/zark-starter/tree/master).
